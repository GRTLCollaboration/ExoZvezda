# ExoChombo

ExoChombo is an open-source code for performing simulations of exotic compact objects, based on the publicly available 
3+1 numerical relativity code [GRChombo](https://github.com/GRChombo/GRChombo). It inherits all of the capabilities of the main code and is developed and maintained by a collaboration of numerical relativists with a wide range of research interests, from early universe cosmology to astrophysics and mathematical general relativity. 

Current exotic compact objects available for evolution: 
* Single and binary evolution of **boson stars** (BSs) :crystal_ball:
